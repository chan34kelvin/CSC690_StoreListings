# How to use it?

1. Open the app and enter the zip code of your store, it will show a list of stores if the zip code was valid.

2. Choose the store where you want to track the product and it will lead you to a list of products in that store.

3. Click your product and simply log in to receive information related to your pick up of the product. 

4. Press refresh to get the latest update on whether your product is ready for pickup. (It doesn't show any alerts saying it refreshed but it does)
